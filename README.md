# models-neuroscience-neuroml-02

Curated collection of **neuroscience NeuroML** models (Part 2 of 4) for the **biosim** platform. This repository contains 406 NeuroML models of neurons, ion channels, synapses, and neural circuits from the NeuroML model database.

## What's Inside

### Models (406 packages)

**Neuroscience NeuroML** — conductance-based neuron models, ion channel dynamics, and synaptic transmission:

**Model Types:** Ion channels (Na+, K+, Ca2+ with Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics), multi-compartmental neurons, AMPA/NMDA/GABA synapses, and small circuit motifs. All models use NeuroML2/LEMS format executed via tellurium/SBML runtime.

**Repository Note:** This is **part 2 of 4** neuroscience-neuroml repositories (split for size management).

## Prerequisites
